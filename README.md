# Handwriting_GAN
Program that imitates your handwriting using GANs, a novel kind of generative neural network.
For explanation and results see www.aekusbhathal.com/proj4.html

## Creating New Samples
I have provided 112 images of my handwriting, but if you would like to create your own, simply run drawing.py with
```
$ python drawing.py
```
A small canvas should pop-up. Enable/Disable penstroke by left-clicking and click 'save' when you are ready to submit your sample.
It will be compressed and stored in Handwriting_samples.

## Running the Model
To run the model, run model.py with
```
$ python model.py
```
Your output images should be saved under a folder called 'output'.
